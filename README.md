# YouTube Transcript to Detailed Note Converter

## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a tool that automatically extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and provides a detailed summary based on the content. The summary generated is concise, offering key points of the video within 300 words, making it easier for users to comprehend the main ideas without having to watch the entire video.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Extract Transcript**: The system uses the `youtube_transcript_api` to fetch the transcript of the YouTube video. The API retrieves the video transcript in multiple languages (supporting Hindi and English in this case).
   
2. **Text Processing**: The transcript is then processed into a single text string for analysis. This allows the transcript to be passed efficiently to the AI model for summarization.

3. **Summarization Using AI**: The transcript text is passed to the Google Gemini AI model using a custom-designed prompt. The model is configured to summarize the video content, ensuring that the response is limited to 300 words and covers the key points of the video.

4. **Streamlit Interface**: The user interacts with the system through a simple Streamlit-based web interface. Users input the YouTube link, and upon clicking the "Get detailed Notes" button, the transcript is fetched, processed, and summarized.

## Libraries Used

- **Streamlit**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for inputting YouTube URLs and displaying the generated summaries.
- **youtube-transcript-api**: Retrieves the transcript of a YouTube video in the desired language.
- **google-generativeai**: Interacts with the Google Gemini AI model to generate content, specifically the summary of the video transcript.
- **python-dotenv**: Loads environment variables (such as the Google API key) securely from a `.env` file.
- **pathlib**: Provides utilities for handling file system paths.

## Evaluation Metrics

The success of the project can be evaluated using the following criteria:

- **Accuracy of Summaries**: Evaluates how well the generated summaries capture the key points of the video content.
- **Transcript Coverage**: Ensures that all important sections of the transcript are included in the summary.
- **Response Time**: Measures the time taken to retrieve the transcript and generate a summary after the user submits the YouTube link.
- **User Feedback**: Collecting feedback from users to assess satisfaction with the accuracy and conciseness of the summaries.

## Results

The system successfully performs the following tasks:

- **Transcript Extraction**: The system is capable of extracting transcripts from YouTube videos in both Hindi and English. The extraction process is efficient, allowing for a quick retrieval of the transcript text.
  
- **AI-based Summarization**: The Google Gemini model generates a concise and accurate summary of the video based on the transcript. The summaries are within the 300-word limit and highlight the main points of the video.

- **Streamlit-based Interface**: The web interface is intuitive, allowing users to easily input YouTube links and view the detailed notes generated by the AI model.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of AI for automatic video summarization, allowing users to save time by obtaining a summary of a video without needing to watch it. The integration of YouTube transcript extraction and Google's Gemini model provides an effective and scalable solution for content summarization.

## Future Work

1. **Multilingual Support**: Extend the system to support more languages for transcript extraction and summarization, catering to a wider audience.
   
2. **Advanced Summarization Options**: Introduce options for users to customize the length and detail of the summaries (e.g., short, medium, long summaries).
   
3. **Real-time Video Processing**: Incorporate real-time video transcription for live streams or videos that do not have pre-generated transcripts available on YouTube.
   
4. **Topic Segmentation**: Develop features to segment videos based on topics or chapters and provide individual summaries for each section.

5. **Integration with Video Players**: Allow users to interact with the video alongside the summary, enabling a more seamless experience where they can view specific sections of the video highlighted in the summary.
